# **Project Summary: High-Speed Corridor Navigation & Human-Aware Collision Mitigation**

---

## **Core Problem Statement**

We aim to design and implement an **autonomous high-speed navigation system** for a robot (modified Traxxas RC car) operating in **narrow indoor corridors** with only ~20–30 cm clearance. The bot must:  

1. **Detect and track static and dynamic obstacles** using LiDAR in real time.  
2. **Prioritize human safety** when conflicts occur, embedding ethical decision-making.  
3. **Plan and execute time-optimal high-speed maneuvers** in tight corridors, respecting dynamic and friction limits.  
4. **Trigger emergency control** (E-MPC) when collisions are inevitable, minimizing impact severity.  
5. Achieve **real-time performance (<80 ms loop)** at speeds up to ~10 m/s.  

The system will integrate **perception, decision-making, planning, and control** inside a **ROS 2 simulation (Gazebo/CARLA)** before any hardware deployment.

## **Motivation and Context**

* Existing **indoor mobile robots** (hospital bots, warehouse AGVs) operate <2 m/s and rely on conservative planners like DWA/TEB.  
* **Corridor racing at 6–10 m/s** introduces challenges not handled by current navigation stacks (tight clearances, oscillation, dynamic pedestrians).  
* **MPC-based racing controllers** (e.g., AMZ Driverless) are proven on racetracks but rarely applied to **indoor corridors** with dynamic human interaction.  
* Our target: bring together **racing-grade MPC/LLA-MPC**, **ethical decision layers**, and **LiDAR-only perception** to enable **fast, safe indoor navigation**.

## **Key Simulation Scenarios**

* **Scenario 1 (Dynamic obstacle avoidance):** Human crosses corridor; bot predicts trajectory and decelerates or sidesteps within corridor bounds.  
* **Scenario 2 (Narrow-gap racing):** Bot maintains stability at ~8 m/s while respecting 20–30 cm wall margins, avoiding oscillations.  
* **Scenario 3 (Inevitable collision minimization):** Pop-up obstacle blocks corridor; E-MPC executes controlled braking/steering to reduce impact.  

These require **predictive dynamics, ethical risk prioritization, and ultra-low-latency planning**.

## **System Requirements**

### Perception (LiDAR-Only)  
* **SLAM & localization:** `slam_toolbox` or Cartographer fused with IMU/odometry.  
* **Dynamic obstacle detection:** clustering + IMM/EKF tracking of moving obstacles.  
* **Human-aware labeling:** classify clusters by shape/speed; inflate costs more for humans.  

### Ethical Decision Layer  
* Cost hierarchy: **Human > Object > Wall**.  
* Corridor costmap augmented with **dynamic risk buffers**.  
* Ethical fallback: when choices are limited, minimize harm severity.  

### Local Planning (Corridor MPC)  
* **Corridor extraction:** compute left/right envelopes, fit centerline spline.  
* **LLA-MPC / MPCC:** optimize progress along centerline subject to corridor bounds, friction, curvature.  
* **Emergency MPC:** short-horizon braking/steering if time-to-collision <0.8 s.  

### Residual RL Augmentation  
* Use **Drive Fast, Learn Faster** or **RLPP** methods as residuals over MPC to handle slip or understeer at high speed.  

### Control Layer  
* Bicycle model with slip angle.  
* 200 Hz ECU loop for torque/brake/steer.  
* Anti-oscillation filters to suppress wall “ping-ponging.”

## **Simulation & Testing Plan (3-Month Focus)**

1. **Baseline corridor sim:** Create narrow corridor worlds in Gazebo/CARLA; validate SLAM + costmap.  
2. **Corridor extraction + speed planner:** Run pure pursuit baseline at 1–2 m/s.  
3. **E-MPC + time-optimal MPC:** Integrate OSQP-based MPC node at 50 Hz; tune for 6–8 m/s runs.  
4. **Dynamic human obstacles:** Insert moving pedestrian models; test ethical prioritization and E-MPC fallbacks.  
5. **Performance metrics:** latency, tracking error, TTC safety margin, collision severity reduction.
